Github-mac replacer
=

Extension which replaces `github-mac` links to any other url provider using template set in the options.

For example, if you want to open github files in IntelliJ IDEA, use following placeholder: `idea://open?file=%base%/%projectname%/%filepath%`.

Note:
- Name of the project should be same on your local machine.
- All cloned projects should be in the single directory (called `base` in the extension).
